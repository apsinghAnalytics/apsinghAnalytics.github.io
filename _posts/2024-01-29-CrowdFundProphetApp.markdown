I'm excited to share with you a bit about a prediction tool I've been working on â€“ *the CrowdFundProphet*! It's powered by a sophisticated machine learning model that I developed as part of my [CrowdOfferingsStudy](https://github.com/apsinghAnalytics/CrowdOfferingsStudy) project. At its heart is a **stacked classifier**, crafted for binary classification. This nifty model is what gives CrowdFundProphet its superpower: making predictions with roughly **80% accuracy**! (Compared to a baseline majority class accuracy of **57.7%** )

In future edits/updates to this blog post, I'll dive deeper into the CrowdOfferingsStudy project. But if you're curious now, feel free to check out the detailed Jupyter notebooks linked below:

#### Data Gathering

 Our journey starts with a Python [web scraper](https://github.com/apsinghAnalytics/CrowdOfferingsStudy/blob/main/Scraper.py) that collected data from all the Form C SEC filings (Form C filings are for Crowdfunding campaigns launched at various Platforms or Intermediaries) from 2016 up to Q3, 2023.

#### Data Cleaning

Next, we gave our data a good scrub. You can see all the nitty-gritty in this [notebook](https://github.com/apsinghAnalytics/CrowdOfferingsStudy/blob/main/DataCleaning.ipynb).

#### Model Building 

The clean data then paved the way for building our ML models. Curious about how it was done? Check out this [notebook](https://github.com/apsinghAnalytics/CrowdOfferingsStudy/blob/main/DataModel.ipynb).

#### Visualization

The cleaned data was also used to create a sleek **Tableau dashboard** to visualize the trends. You can explore it [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aditya.prakash.singh/viz/CrowdfundingTrendsDashboard/Dashboard). (Quick note for those on smaller desktop screens: switch to **'Desktop Layout'** on Tableau Public for the best view)

Stay tuned for more updates and insights.
